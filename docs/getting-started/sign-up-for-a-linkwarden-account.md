# Sign Up for a Linkwarden account

Signing up on Linkwarden is pretty simple and straightforward.

:::tip

If you had any questions, feel free to reach out to us at [support@linkwarden.app](mailto:support@linkwarden.app).

:::

### Step 1: Register and confirm your email

Head to [cloud.linkwarden.app/register](https://cloud.linkwarden.app/register), from there you should enter:

- A Display Name, which can be pretty much anything and it doesn't have to be unique.
- An email, which is the **ONLY** form of validation when you need support with your account and recovery.
- And password, the only "note" here is that it should be 8 or more characters.

:::note

Your email is your **ONLY** form of validation for dedicated support or account recovery. To ensure accuracy, a confirmation link will be sent to your email, which requires a simple click.

### Step 2: Complete your Subscription

After clicking on the confirmation email, you will be asked to click on the "Complete your Subscription" button, which is managed by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), the payment infrastructure that millions of businesses rely on.

The service comes with a 14 days free trial, but to prevent abuse, you will need to enter your payment method up front.

### Final step: Choose a Username

This is the last step, you should be selecting a unique username, this can be changed later in settings.
