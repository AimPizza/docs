# Self Hosting

:::note

Docker is on its way! üêã

:::

Here you can find everything you need to setup a fully fledged Linkwarden instance on your own server.

## Requirements

Here are all the requirements to hook up your own instance:

### Hardware

Linkwarden has a pretty minimal hardware requirements - it was tested on a 2gb VPS and it ran pretty smoothly, the most intense part is when you build the app, but once it's running it's relatively lightweight.

### Operating System

Linkwarden supports all major desktop OS's (Linux, MacOS, Windows), but note that Linux is preferred.

### Software

To setup Linkwarden, you'll first need to install a few things:

- git
- node.js
- yarn
- postgres

## Installation

:::note

The commands may vary by which OS you use.

:::

#### 1. Start by cloning the repository with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden.git
```

#### 2. Change directory to the cloned repo using the following command:

```
cd linkwarden
```

And run:

```
yarn
```

To install the dependencies.

#### 3. Create a file named `.env`:

```
touch .env
```

And open it:

```
nano .env
```

#### 4. Copy and paste the following and define the values:

```
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
DATABASE_URL=
NEXTAUTH_URL=
```

So basically:

- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A **SUPER** sensitive secret that you should keep it safe, you don't need to memorize it like a password.
- `DATABASE_URL`: This is your database connection string, which has a format like this:

```
postgresql://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@localhost:[PORT]/[DATABASE]
```

Where `[USERNAME]` is your postgres username, `[PASSWORD]` is your postgres password, `[PORT]` is the port that postgres is running on (usually `5432`) and `[DATABASE]` is the postgres database.

#### 5. Build the app using the following command:

```
yarn build
```

#### 6. Setup the database using the Prisma schema:

```
yarn prisma migrate deploy
```

#### 7. Start the app:

```
yarn start
```
