## Links, Tags, and Collections

At the core there's three types of data you're dealing with:

- **Link**: Also known as Bookmark, Webpage, or URL.
- **Collection**: Think of this as a folder, which then can be shared with your team and/or with the public.
- **Tags**: An additional layer of categorization through keywords for individual Links, enabling precise filtering and searching.

Each user can have an unlimited number of Links, Tags, and Collections.

### Difference between Collections and Tags

Simply saying, each Link can only belong to one Collection, but can have multiple Tags. Another difference lies in its sharability, Collections can be shared and collaborated on, but on the other hand Tags are not shareable.
