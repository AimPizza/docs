## Manage visibility

In the second tab of the Settings modal, you can click on the "**Make profile private**" checkbox, if you click Save, this will immediately prevent access to you profile from anyone.

### Whitelist Specific Users

If you need to collaborate with a friend or colleague while keeping your profile private, you can add their unique username (not display name!) below the checkbox, seperated by comma.
