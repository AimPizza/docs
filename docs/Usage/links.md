# Links

Link, also known as Bookmark, Webpage, or URL is one of the core components of Linkwarden (hence the name).

## Adding a Link

You can add a new Link by clicking the "**+ New Link**" button on the top-right of the screen.

A couple of things to consider:

- The "Address" field is mandatory.
- The "Collection" field is also mandatory, BUT will be set as "**Unorganized**" if nothing is provided. So a new Collection (named "Unorganized") will be created.
- The "Description" field will be autogenerated based on the webpage title if nothing is provided.
- The "Name" field overwrights the "Description" field while being displayed in the Link card.
